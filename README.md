# mister-server

## Manual Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/tatsutron/mister-server/releases), and put `S99mister-server` into your MiSTer's `/etc/init.d/` folder using `scp` at the command line (e.g. `scp "S99mister-server" root@MiSTer:/etc/init.d`). Put all the other files into `/media/fat/tatsutron/mister-server/`. Then reboot your MiSTer. From now on, `mister-server` will start up automatically whenever your MiSTer is powered on.
